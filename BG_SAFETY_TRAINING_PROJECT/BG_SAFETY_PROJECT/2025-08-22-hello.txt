● Configuration Analysis Summary

  Your project is properly configured for Tomcat deployment with some minor issues to address:

  ✅ What's Correct:

  - Maven WAR packaging configured in pom.xml
  - Servlet annotations (@WebServlet) properly defined for all endpoints
  - Database dependencies (MySQL connector, Gson) present
  - Servlet API correctly marked as "provided" scope
  - Standard web app structure with WEB-INF folder

  ⚠️ Issues Found:

  1. Missing servlet mappings in web.xml - Currently only has welcome files, no servlet mappings (web.xml:1-12)
  2. Hardcoded database credentials in DBConnection.java:13 (username: "root", password: "root")
  3. Missing Java compiler version in pom.xml

  🔧 Required Fixes:

  Add to pom.xml:
  <properties>
      <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
      <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>

  📡 Available API Endpoints:

  - /login (POST) - User authentication
  - /admin (GET) - Dashboard statistics
  - /employee (GET/POST) - Employee management
  - /training (GET/POST) - Training management
  - /employee-training - Employee training assignments
  - /logout - User logout

  🚀 Deployment Status:

  Ready for Tomcat deployment. The servlets use annotations so web.xml mappings aren't required. Ensure your
  database "bg_safety_db" exists on localhost:3306.

● ❌ Missing Dependencies Found

  Your system is missing the required tools to run the project:

  What's Available:

  - ✅ Java 22.0.2 (installed)

  What's Missing:

  - ❌ Apache Maven - Required to build the WAR file
  - ❌ Apache Tomcat - Required to run the web application

  Installation Required:

  1. Install Apache Maven:
  - Download from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  - Extract and add bin directory to your PATH
  - Set MAVEN_HOME environment variable

  2. Install Apache Tomcat:
  - Download from: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi
  - Extract and set CATALINA_HOME environment variable
  - Default port: 8080

  Alternative Quick Setup:

  You can use embedded Tomcat with Maven plugin. I can modify your pom.xml to include the Tomcat Maven plugin,
  which would allow you to run:
  mvn tomcat7:run

  Would you like me to:
  1. Help you install Maven and Tomcat manually, or
  2. Add the embedded Tomcat plugin to your project for easier development?

  ⎿  Maven not found - checking for Maven wrapper

● Bash(dir mvnw.cmd 2>nul || echo "Maven wrapper not found")
  ⎿  Maven wrapper not found

● Since Maven is not available, I'll help you install it or provide alternatives. Let me check what's available on
  your system for package management.

● Bash(where choco)
  ⎿  C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco.exe

● Bash(where winget)
  ⎿  Error: INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).

● Great! Chocolatey is available. I'll install Maven using Chocolatey and then build and run your project.

● Bash(choco install maven -y)
  ⎿  Error: Chocolatey v1.1.0
     Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
      (cmd/powershell).
     
      You may experience errors - many functions/packages
      require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
      elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure
      that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are
      attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you
      must select a different location other than the default install
     … +43 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

● The installation failed due to permissions. Let me try an alternative approach - I'll check if we can download
  and set up Maven manually or use a different method.

● Bash(refreshenv && mvn --version)
  ⎿  Error: /usr/bin/bash: line 1: refreshenv: command not found

● Bash(mvn --version)

● Let me try a portable approach - downloading a portable Maven version or using an IDE-based solution. First, let
  me check if there's an existing Maven installation in common locations.

● Bash(dir "C:\Program Files\*maven*" 2>nul || dir "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\*maven*" 2>nul || echo "No Maven
      installations found")
  ⎿  No Maven installations found

● Since we're having permission issues with installing Maven, let me provide you with manual installation
  instructions and then check if your database is set up correctly for when Maven becomes available.

● ⚠️ Status Update

  I've updated your project configuration successfully, but we encountered some setup issues:

  ✅ Completed:

  - ✅ Updated pom.xml with Java 11 compiler settings
  - ✅ Added Tomcat Maven plugin for embedded server
  - ✅ Added Maven compiler plugin configuration

  ❌ Issues Found:

  1. Maven installation failed - Permission denied during Chocolatey installation
  2. MySQL not running - Database server not accessible

  🛠️ Required Manual Setup:

  To proceed, you need to:

  1. Install Maven manually:
    - Download from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
    - Extract to C:\apache-maven-3.9.11
    - Add C:\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin to your PATH environment variable
  2. Start MySQL database:
    - Ensure MySQL server is running on localhost:3306
    - Create database bg_safety_db
    - Verify username/password: root/root

  🚀 Once Setup is Complete:

  Run these commands to start your application:
  mvn clean compile
  mvn tomcat7:run

  Your application will be available at: http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT

  API endpoints will be accessible at:
  - http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/login
  - http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/admin
  - http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/employee
  - http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/training

  Would you like me to help you create database setup scripts while you install Maven?

> ok i have set the maven and the db also

● Perfect! Now let's test Maven and build your project, then start the Tomcat server.

      --version 2>nul || echo "Maven not found in common pat…)
  ⎿  Maven not found in common paths

● It seems the PATH hasn't been updated yet. Let me check if Maven is installed but not in PATH:

● Bash(where /R C:\ mvn.cmd 2>nul | head -5)
  ⎿  ERROR: Invalid pattern is specified in "path:pattern".

● Bash(dir "C:\apache-maven*" 2>nul || dir "C:\Program Files\*maven*" 2>nul || echo "Maven installation not found")
  ⎿  Maven installation not found

● Let me provide you with step-by-step instructions to verify your Maven installation and then we can proceed:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  [ ] Guide user to verify Maven installation 
     [ ] Test database connectivity
     [ ] Build the WAR file using Maven
     [ ] Start Tomcat server with embedded plugin
     [ ] Test API endpoints

● 🔍 Maven Setup Verification Needed

  The system can't find Maven yet. Please verify your installation:

  Step 1: Check Maven Installation

  Open a new Command Prompt and run:
  mvn --version

  Step 2: If Maven is not found, check these locations:

  dir "C:\apache-maven*" /s
  dir "C:\Program Files\*maven*" /s

  Step 3: Add to PATH (if needed)

  If Maven is installed but not in PATH:
  1. Find your Maven installation directory (e.g., C:\apache-maven-3.9.11)
  2. Add C:\apache-maven-3.9.11\bin to your system PATH
  3. Restart your Command Prompt/Terminal

  Step 4: Database Check

  Also verify MySQL is running:
  mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"

  Once both are working, let me know and I'll proceed with building and running your project!

  Alternatively, if you'd like to try right now, you can run these commands in your new Command Prompt in the
  project directory:
  cd "D:\BROTHERS GAS PROJECTS\BG_SAFETY_TRAINING_PROJECT\BG_SAFETY_PROJECT"
  mvn --version
  mvn clean compile
  mvn tomcat7:run
