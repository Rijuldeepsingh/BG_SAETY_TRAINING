# BG Safety Training Project - Setup and Configuration Documentation

## Project Overview
Successfully configured and deployed a Java web application for Brothers Gas Safety Training using Maven, Tomcat, and MySQL.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Project Analysis & Configuration
- **Analyzed existing project structure** - Java web application with servlet-based architecture
- **Updated pom.xml** with proper Maven configuration:
  - Added Java 11 compiler settings
  - Added Tomcat Maven plugin for embedded server
  - Added Maven compiler plugin configuration
- **Verified database connectivity** - MySQL connection working with `bg_safety_db`

### 2. Server Setup & Deployment
- **Installed Maven** - Version 3.9.11 successfully configured
- **Configured embedded Tomcat** - Port 8080 with context path `/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT`
- **Built and deployed application** using `mvn clean compile` and `mvn tomcat7:run`
- **Resolved port conflicts** and process management issues

### 3. Web Interface Development
- **Created missing JSP files**:
  - `login.jsp` - Professional login page with error handling
  - `dashboard.jsp` - Full-featured dashboard with role-based access
- **Fixed welcome page issue** - Moved `Index.jsp` from `WEB-INF` to webapp root as `index.jsp`
- **Implemented responsive design** with embedded CSS styling

### 4. API Testing & Validation
- **Tested login API endpoints**:
  - `POST /BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/login` - Authentication endpoint working
  - `GET /BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/` - Homepage accessible
  - `GET /BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/login.jsp` - Direct login page access
- **Verified error handling** - Failed login attempts show proper error messages
- **Confirmed database integration** - Login servlet processes authentication correctly

## Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Backend**: Java servlets with Maven build system
- **Database**: MySQL (`bg_safety_db`) with JDBC connectivity
- **Server**: Embedded Tomcat 7 via Maven plugin
- **Frontend**: JSP pages with embedded CSS
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with DAO layer

## Available Endpoints
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/` - Main application homepage
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/login` - Authentication API (POST)
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/employee` - Employee management
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/training` - Training management
- `http://localhost:8080/BG_SAFETY_PROJECT/employee-training` - Training assignments

## Key Features Implemented
- **User Authentication** - Login system with session management
- **Role-based Access** - Admin and staff/user role differentiation
- **Training Management** - Employee training tracking and assignment
- **Dashboard Interface** - Statistics display and management actions
- **Error Handling** - Proper error messages and user feedback

## Development Commands
```bash
# Build project
mvn clean compile

# Run development server
mvn tomcat7:run

# Check port usage
netstat -ano | grep :8080

# Force stop server process
powershell.exe -Command "Stop-Process -Id [PID] -Force"
```

## Project Status: âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL
The BG Safety Training Project is successfully configured, deployed, and ready for use with a complete web interface and functional API endpoints.
